THE HUNT FOR RED, WHITE, AND BLUE OCTOBER

In the year 2084, in the Atlantic Ocean, you are a Russian submarine hunting for a secret Super-Ohio Class American nuclear submarine called Red White and Blue October, 
hoping to intercept and destroy it before it reaches the Baltic Sea and launches a nuclear strike. 
(This is a futuristic role-reversal parody of Tom Clancy's "The Hunt for Red October")

How to play:

	~ Movement is controlled with WASD keys
		~ You move up and down and with W and S and strafe left and right with A and D
	~ Weapons are controlled with Left and Right Mouse Buttons (or trackpad, if you have no mouse)
		~ Sonic Javelin (main weapon) is fired with left click
		~ Torpedoes do more damage with a longer cooldown, and are fired with right click
	~ Items will show up every so often, which offer various boosts. You collide with them to attain the boost.
		~ Repair kits (Soviet toolbox) will repair your hull (health) so you can continue the fight
		~ Weapon upgrades will increase the damage your weapons do. They are stackable
		~ Sonic Immunity Fields are a power-up that makes you invlunerable for 10 seconds
	~ List of enemies (all enemies move using physical-based motion unless parametric is specified):
		~ Mines
			~ Basic naval mine, revolves in a circle with parametric motion, collision damages you
		~ Ford Class American Attack Submarines
			~ Enemy submarines will strafe back and forth firing 2 torpedoes in 2 diagonal directions towards you
		~ Submarine Hyperaquatic Autonomous Reconnaissance Killer (S.H.A.R.K.) drones
			~ SHARK drones will use pursuit behaviour and move toward you, firing Sonic Javelin shots along the way
		~ Red, White, and Blue October
			~ Boss enemy which spawns as the final fight of the game. Moves similarly to the Ford Class Submarines
			~ Has 4 turrets, each of which fire Sonic Javelins at you
			~ Fires 3 torpedoes in a similar fashion to the other enemy subs, but also one down the middle
			~ You must destroy the 4 turrets before being able to damage the boss
			~ Game ends upon boss defeat
